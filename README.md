# WebDev Training

## Overview

This folder contains all of my coding exercises, projects, and notes from my training with [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). 

Each file and project within this folder represents a different stage of my learning process, from basic to more advanced HTML & CSS. 

## How to Use

1. Navigate through the folders to find specific topics or projects.
2. Open the files in your preferred code editor to view or modify.
3. Follow along with the Free Code Camp curriculum for reference.
